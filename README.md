# Repository templates

The repositories here are intended to be used as templates for your own repositories. They aim to provide sensible default starting points so you can get up and running quickly, without worrying about the basics of getting your repo/project up and running.

## What's provided?

Depending on the template you choose a number of items may be provided:

* `.gitignore` - Usually using [gitignore.io](https://gitignore.io) as a starting point. with These will include:
  * OSs rules - Linux, Windows, and OS X cruft
  * Editors & IDEs rules - Common editors and IDEs that may leave temporary files in repository directories
  * Language/framework rules 
* `.gitattributes` - Line ending and diff configurations
* Language/framework specific files, aiming to have something usable out of the box (albeit just a Hello World example):
  * Project file
  * Basic app/service example (as minimal as possible whilst still being runnable)
  * Build scripts
  * GitHub Action workflows
* `README.md` - Explaining how to get started with the language/framework within the template
* `PLACEHOLDERS.md` - A list of placeholders within the repository, with instructions about how best to replace them.

### What won't be provided

* `LICENSE` - We're not here to enforce any particular license on you.

## How to use a template?

Choose a template you'd like to use, and on the main page of the repository there should be a 'Use this template' button.

Once your new repository is created, there may be some placeholders which you should change for real values. These will be indicated in a `PLACEHOLDERS.md` file.

_By the way, the `README.md` may have a reference back here at the bottom. That's just in case people find the templates without understanding how to use it. Feel free to remove it._

## Contributing a new template/idea

If your idea is about an existing template, create an issue within that template's repository. For artifacts you think would be useful across all templates, create an issue in [the `base` template repository](https://github.com/repotemplates/base/issues).

If you have an idea for a new template which doesn't already exist, feel free to suggest it by creating an [issue on the `repotemplates` repository](https://github.com/repotemplates/repotemplates/issues).
